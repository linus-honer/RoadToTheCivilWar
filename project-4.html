                        James Murray Mason was an American  Confederate diplomat who strongly supported slavery and the secession of Virginia from the United States. He became the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in 1851, and wrote the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 after the Kansas-Nebraska act and Bleeding Kansas.

                        The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 wash written as a part of the Compromise of 1850, and was written by Mason, who was a strong supporter of slavery in the South. The law was strongly backed by many Southern leaders, who wanted a stronger way to enforce the return of runaway slaves especially because of the underground railroad. It also received intense opposition from Northern leaders who saw it as a violation of individual rights, and was a major cause in the increased sectional tension in the U.S.
