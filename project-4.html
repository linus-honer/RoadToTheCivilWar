                        Charles Sumner, a part of the newly formed Republican Party, was extremely influential in the events leading up to the Civil War. Sumner was a strong advocate for civil rights and the emancipation of enslaved people, and used his position in the U.S. Senate to oppose the expansion of slavery into new territories.

                        A few years before the beginning of the Civil War, Sumner delivered a speech in the Senate titled “The Crime Against Kansas,” which was met with backlash from many people in attendance, including Congressman Preston Brooks of South Carolina, who severely injured Sumner with a cane.
