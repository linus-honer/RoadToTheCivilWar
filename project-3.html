                        John Punch arrived in Virginia in the early 17th century. Much like many others in this period, he was brought as an indentured servant with a servitude period of around 4-7 years originally.

                    <p>
                        Punch tried to escape on July 9th, 1640 alongside two white servants, but was captured in Maryland and brought back. A decision was made to only give the two white servants additional years to their servitude, John Punch was sentenced to slavery for life. This marked the earliest example of hereditary slavery in the U.S.

                    <p>
                        After the John Punch decision, the practice of hereditary slavery began expanding significantly, and it was a key issue dividing the North and the South. Before this case, many African laborers were treated very similarly to European indentured servants, but the John Punch decision created a significant change in the practice of slavery, making it more common for servitude to be extended for life.
