                        John Jacob Astor was born on July 17, 1763, and immigrated to the U.S. from Germany as a teenager. He is most well known for founding the Pacific Fur Company in 1810 as a subsidiary of the American Fur Company.

                        His wealth from the fur trade and other income sources allowed him to keep strong connections with prominent political figures in both the Union and Confederate sides of the Civil War.

                        The fur trade monopoly created by John Jacob Astor cause mass migration to more Western land in the U.S, making many people panic to decide how slavery would be expanded. The founding of the Pacific Fur company was a large factor in the beginning of the Civil War.

                    <p>
                        Astorâ€™s stance on slavery is not clearly documented because he did not write a detailed record about his personal views on slavery, but his link to the fur trade and thus his connection to the expansion of the american frontier can provide some insight.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        He had limited ties to the Southern economy and mostly operated in the North with his real estate investments in New York, which suggests that he did not strongly oppose slavery, as many wealthy northerners had no stance or indirectly supported it.
